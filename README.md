# obigo_teleca_exploits
A collection of html files targeting the god awful programming of the built in web browser on the LG 306g.

The web browser in question is branded teleca/obigo. A similar or same browser is also on the LG Voyager (vx10000).

To run these files on the phone:

1.) Host the files on a web server.
  Any computer will do. Even my lowly inspiron 700m has plenty of horsepower for this.
  (PS: Apache serves the files at /var/www/html, incase you forgot or didn't know ;) )
  
2.) Connect the phone to wifi.
  May I suggest getting really close to the router. This phone doesn't exactly have "big ears".

3.) Connect to the web server.
